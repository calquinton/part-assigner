# App Vision
The app is meant for Percussionists in a Symphony Band or Orchestra who need to assign parts to percussionists based on importance of the part and skill of the percussionist.
## Percussionists
A profile/object will be made of each percussionist that can be saved and stored for later use on other pieces or semesters
- Attributes storing skill in the following on a scale from 1-10:
  - Keyboard
  - Snare
  - Aux
  - Timpani
  - Drums
## Percussion Parts
Each Song/Piece will have parts associated with them. There will be an ability to create a Piece and have Parts associated with each piece. 
- There will be an ability to name each piece and the parts associated with it
- Each Song will have an importance assigned based on the following:
  - Base: 1 (most important)
  - Snare: 2
  - Cymbals: 3
  - Timpani: 4
  - Mallets: 5
- Each part will have an assigned category of one of the 5 attributes listed above upon creation by the user
- Each part will also have a difficulty on a scale from 1-10 assigned by the user upon creation.
## Auto-Assign
The app will then auto-assign each percussionist one piece per song based on the importance of the part and skill level in each area. (unless there are more or fewer parts than percussionists, then adjustments will be made)
## Reports and Visual Aids
1. Chart of who plays what parts in what song
2. How often each player is playing what part
3. List of all of the instruments needed for every piece, broken down by which instruments are on which piece
